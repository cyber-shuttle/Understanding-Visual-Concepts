# Understanding-Visual-Concepts

This repository contains code for understanding and predicting visual attributes using various pre-trained vision models. It focuses on the Visual Attributes in the Wild (VAW) dataset and includes functionalities for extracting attributes, setting up models, computing embeddings, and preparing data for training and testing.

## Features

- Extraction of visual attributes from JSON files.
- Setup and use of pre-trained vision models (DINOv2 in current implimentation) for feature extraction.
- Computation and storage of image embeddings.
- Preparation of training and testing datasets for machine learning models.
- Handling of label imbalance and attribute-specific processing.
