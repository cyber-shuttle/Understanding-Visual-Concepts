    "This Jupyter notebook is designed to analyze the simulation output of the thalamocortical network model described in the paper \"Cellular and neurochemical basis of sleep stages in the thalamocortical network\" by Krishnan et al. The notebook guides you through the process of setting up the environment, running the simulation, loading the output data, and performing various analyses to understand the transitions between different sleep stages."
